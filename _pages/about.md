Hi there! 

👩‍💻 I'm a master's student at Hult International Business School San Francisco (August 2024).

📊 I'm aspiring to be a data scientist or machine learning engineer.

Hailing from the beautiful place Philippines, I bring with me my passion for Chemical Engineering. My passion led me to San Francisco to see more of the mysteries and beauty of data.

You can call me **Jo-anne**, and here's a fun fact for you: I can effortlessly recite the alphabet backwards and I bring that same level of creativity and innovation in everything I do.

I moved to San Francisco to pursue a "Master's Degree in Business Analytics," aiming to transition into roles within the data science field. I have a goal of joining a global data-centric, data-driven team, and growth-focused tech industry. 

My dream? Not only to analyze data but also drive business outcomes and innovate people experience by contributing and making impactful software solutions.
