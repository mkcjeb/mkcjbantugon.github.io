Hi there! You can call me **Jo-anne**, and here's a fun fact for you: I can effortlessly recite the alphabet backwards and I bring that same level of creativity and innovation in everything I do.

I moved to San Francisco to pursue a "Master's Degree in Business Analytics," aiming to transition into roles within the data science field. I have a goal of joining a global data-centric, data-driven team, and growth-focused tech industry. 

My dream? Not only to analyze data but also drive business outcomes and innovate people experience by contributing and making impactful software solutions.
