### Introduction

The meal kit market is competitive, with new players joining every day, as well as traditional grocery stores which are now also offering customers semi-prepared kits (Forbes, 2018). However, research shows consumers continue to order meal kits due to health reasons and getting to know new recipes (Nielsen, 2017).
<br>
Therefore, it is essential to diversify our revenue streams at Apprentice Chef through different promotions such as Halfway There, a wine subscription service.



### Overview

- Our best performing model was a Decision Tree with 21 features with a test score of 0.9058
- Optimal features were found using exploratory data analysis, domain knowledge and tree classifiers
- It is predicting whether or not a customer will subscribe to the new service Halfway There.
- Its precision in correctly predicting a new customer is 96%

<strong> Case: Apprentice Chef, Inc. </strong> <br>
<i> Audience: Top Executives </i> <br><br>
<strong> Context: </strong> <i> Halfway There </i>, new subscription where customers can receive a half bottle of wine from a local California vineyard every Wednesday. <br>
<strong> Goal: </strong> when promoting this service to a wider audience, know which customers will subscribe to <i> Halfway There </i> <br>
<strong> Target consumer: </strong> busy professional, little to no skills in the kitchen <br>
<strong> Product: </strong> daily-prepared gourmet meals delivered <br>
<strong> Channels: </strong> online platform and mobile app <br> 
<strong> Revenue: </strong> 90% of revenue comes from customers that have been ordering for 12 months or less


<br> General Product Specifications: 
- at most 30 min to finish cooking
- disposable cookware
- delicious and healthy eating<br>

<br> Halfway There Specifications:
- hard to find local wines
- customer need to include government ID in application process to order
<br>
Channels: online platform and mobile app
Revenue: 90% of revenue comes from customers that have been ordering for 12 months or less

***
<strong> Data and Assumptions </strong> <br>
Dataset:
<br> 2,000 customers (approx.)
- at least one purchase per month for a total of 11 of their first 12 months
- at least one purchase per quarter and at least 15 purchases through their first year
- dataset engineering techniques are statistically sound and represent the customers


Assumptions:
- all average times are in seconds
- revenue = price x quantity and total meals ordered represent quantity
- all customers have included their government ID in the registration process
- price of subscription to halfway there is the average price of half-bottle of wine in the menu
- bottle is delivered on Wednesday regardless if the customer has ordered a meal that day or not
- upon registration, each customer gave a phone number (required for registration) and optionally gave an email address
- each customer was able to set their preferred contact method (optional). If not set, customers will be contacted via SMS if their phone number was mobile, and via a direct sales call if their phone number was a landline.

Data Quality issues:
- cancellations before noon and after noon: dictionary specifies after noon as after 3pm. There are 3 hours of data for cancellations missing.

## Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this section, our objective is too understand the data and identify possible insights that will be useful for business application. We'll also go through feature engineering (creating new variables) where we deem appropriate.
<br> <br>

<strong> Observations: </strong>
- Data types are coherent with each variable description
- 47 missing values in Family Name
- Number of observations: 1946
- Total of 28 variables (including target variable) where:
    - 3 are floats
    - 22 are integers
    - 4 are objects
    
   
For this purpose, it is important to identify the different variable types in our model:


```python
# Defining lists for each type of variable:
categorical = ['CROSS_SELL_SUCCESS',     # (target variable - binary)
               'MOBILE_NUMBER',          # (also binary)
               'TASTES_AND_PREFERENCES', # (also binary)
               'PACKAGE_LOCKER',         # (also binary)
               'REFRIGERATED_LOCKER']    # (also binary)

continuous = ['REVENUE',
              'AVG_TIME_PER_SITE_VISIT',
              'FOLLOWED_RECOMMENDATIONS_PCT',
              'AVG_PREP_VID_TIME',
              'MEDIAN_MEAL_RATING',]     # (interval)

counts = ['TOTAL_MEALS_ORDERED',
          'UNIQUE_MEALS_PURCH',
          'CONTACTS_W_CUSTOMER_SERVICE',
          'PRODUCT_CATEGORIES_VIEWED',
          'CANCELLATIONS_BEFORE_NOON',
          'CANCELLATIONS_AFTER_NOON',
          'MOBILE_LOGINS',
          'PC_LOGINS',
          'WEEKLY_PLAN',
          'EARLY_DELIVERIES',
          'LATE_DELIVERIES',
          'MASTER_CLASSES_ATTENDED',
          'TOTAL_PHOTOS_VIEWED',
          'LARGEST_ORDER_SIZE',
          'AVG_CLICKS_PER_VISIT']
```

### A) Anomaly Detection: Missing Values

<strong> Purpose: </strong> Identify and create a strategy for missing values.
<br>
Missing values can affect our model and our ability to create plots to identify other features in our data.


```python
# Inspecting missing values
chef_org.isnull().sum()
chef_org.loc[:,:][chef_org['FAMILY_NAME'].isna()]

# Flagging missing variables for FAMILY_NAME
# creating a copy of dataframe for safety measures
chef_m = chef_org.copy()

# creating a new column where 1 indicates that observation has a missing family name
chef_m['m_FAMILY_NAME'] = chef_m['FAMILY_NAME'].isnull().astype(int)

# imputing missing values
chef_m['FAMILY_NAME'] = chef_m['FAMILY_NAME'].fillna('Unknown')

# checking to see if missing values were imputed
chef_m.isnull().sum()
```

### B) Anomaly Detection: Sample Size Check

<strong> Purpose: </strong> Identify size of each category in categorical variables.

***
We need to see if the size of each of the categories is large enough to infer statistical significance or insignificance. If not, the variable could be insignificant to predict cross sell success when in reality its sample size is too small. <br> <br>
Additionally, since our target variable is binary, we want to ensure we have the same number of success and failure values in our sampling.


```python
for variable in chef_org:
    if variable in categorical:
        print(f"""{variable}
------
{chef_org[variable].value_counts()}
          
    """)
```

```python
"""
CROSS_SELL_SUCCESS
------
1    1321
0     625
Name: CROSS_SELL_SUCCESS, dtype: int64
          
    
MOBILE_NUMBER
------
1    1708
0     238

------

PACKAGE_LOCKER
------
0    1255
1     691
Name: PACKAGE_LOCKER, dtype: int64
          
    
REFRIGERATED_LOCKER
------
0    1726
1     220
Name: REFRIGERATED_LOCKER, dtype: int64
"""
```

<strong> Observations: </strong>
- Sample size for each option in all categorical variables are large enough for analysis (all contain above 200 observations)
- Sample size for target variable is large enough. We will need to use stratification methods in our splitting of training and testing in the model to make sure we have both success and failures in both training and testing.
<br><br> 
In this sample of customers, our <strong> success in selling Halfway There was about 88% ! </strong>
<br>

### C) Anomaly Detection: Outliers

<strong> Purpose: </strong> Outliers affect most predictive models. It increases variance in a variable, and therefore need to be flagged for two main reasons: <br> <br>
1) Using outlier flag variable in our model quantifies the affect of that outlier on the variable we are trying to predict (in this case, cross sell success) <br>
2) In some cases, removing outliers can improve our predictions and increase generalization of our model <br> <br>

***

In the following code, we visualize each variable's distribution with an user-defined function and we look at the quartile ranges using descriptive statistics. We then set thresholds which will determine which observations are going to be considered as outliers in this analysis. Finally, we create a new column for each of the variables that contain outliers, where a 1 will be imputed for outlier observations. <br><br>
<i> Note: no outliers are removed in the part of the analysis <i> <br><br>


```python
# Visualizing variable distributions
for variable in continuous + counts:
    distributions(variable, chef_m, bins = 'fd', kde = True, rug = False)
```

<strong> Observations:</strong>
- Revenue: big dip in clients with revenue at approx 2,000 
- Avg Time per Site Visit (in seconds): almost a normal distribution, outliers after 200 (3.3 min)    
- Followed Recommendations Percentage: outliers after 80%  and before 10%   
- Average Preparation Video Time (in seconds): almost a normal distribution, outliers after 250 (approx 4 min)    
- Largest Order Size: almost normal distribution, after 5: a family is usually 4 - 5 people, more than that it could be that these customers are throwing dinner parties or keeping the meals for the next day
- Median Meal Rating: peak on 3, no obvious outliers
- Average Clicks per visit: outliers before 10
- Total Meals Ordered: strong dip in around 25 - investigate, outliers after 320    
- Unique Meals Purchased: outliers after 10    
- Contacts with customer service: outliers after 13    
- Product Categories Viewed: after 9 and before 2
- Cancellations Before Noon: approx exponential distribution, outliers after 8   
- Cancellations After Noon: no obvious outliers   
- Mobile Log-ins: no obvious outliers  
- PC Log-ins: no obvious outliers
- Weekly Plan: no obvious outliers
- Early Deliveries: peak on 0, no obvious outliers
- Late Deliveries: outliers after 17   
- Master Class Attended: no obvious outliers  
- Total Photos Viewed: peak on 0, outliers after 800   
- Revenue per meal: Outliers after 80 dollars

### D) Feature Engineering: Email Domains

<strong> Purpose </strong>: 
<br>
When we promote Halfway There to a wider customer base, we could choose from several promotion methods (ex: sales call, flyers, email, SMS...). With our customers email domains, we can identify if the email provided in the application process is a professional or personal email, or if they have provided a 'junk' email (an inbox they never open but use to avoid spam). 
<br>


By adding these features in our analysis, we are able to identify if customers that use their personal or professional emails are more likely to buy the subscription. If so, it would be a good idea to implement an email marketing campaign to these customers. It would also confirm the need to run a campaign in another platform if we see the potential in customers with 'junk' emails.
<br> <br>
In the next steps, we will first select the email domain for each customer, then create a new categorical variable where each domain is classified as "personal", "professional" or "junk". Finally, we will be one-hot encoding this new variable which will create three new columns for each email category. In these new columns, if an email corresponds to the column, that observation will take on the value 1.


```python
# STEP 1: splitting emails
# placeholder list
placeholder_lst = []

# looping over each email address
for index, col in chef_o.iterrows():
    
    # splitting email domain at '@'
    split_email = chef_o.loc[index, 'EMAIL'].split(sep = '@')

    # appending placeholder_lst with the results
    placeholder_lst.append(split_email)
    
# converting placeholder_lst into a DataFrame
email_df = pd.DataFrame(placeholder_lst)

# STEP 2: concatenating with original DataFrame
# Creating a copy of chef for features and safety measure
chef_v = chef_o.copy()

# renaming column to concatenate
email_df.columns = ['name' , 'EMAIL_DOMAIN'] 

# concatenating personal_email_domain with chef DataFrame
chef_v = pd.concat([chef_v, email_df.loc[:, 'EMAIL_DOMAIN']], 
                   axis = 1)

# printing value counts of personal_email_domain
chef_v.loc[: ,'EMAIL_DOMAIN'].value_counts()

# email domain types
professional_email_domains = ['@mmm.com',         '@amex.com',
                              '@apple.com',       '@boeing.com',

            placeholder_lst.append('junk')
            
        else:
            print('Unknown')


# concatenating with original DataFrame
chef_v['email_domain_group'] = pd.Series(placeholder_lst)

# checking results and sample size
#print(chef['email_domain_group'].value_counts())

# Step 3: One-Hot encoding
one_hot_email_domain = pd.get_dummies(chef_v['email_domain_group'])

# dropping orginal columns to keep only encoded ones
chef_e               = chef_v.drop(['email_domain_group','EMAIL','EMAIL_DOMAIN'], axis = 1)

# joining encoded columns to dataset
chef_e               = chef_e.join(one_hot_email_domain)

# including new categorical variables to list
domains              = ['professional','personal','junk']

### Only run once!
categorical          = categorical + domains

### D) Feature Engineering: Computing New Variables

<strong> Purpose: </strong> Our analysis can benefit from the creation of new features based on the data we already have. <br>

***

<strong> Feature: </strong> Revenue per meal <br> <br>
Our goal in creating Halfway There is to diversify revenue. This feature will hopefully shed a light on how much a customer spends on a meal. Hopefully, we can identify certain customer segments according to this new variable.


```python
# creating a copy of dataframe for safety measures
chef_n = chef_e.copy()

# placeholder for 'rev_per_meal' feature
chef_n['rev_per_meal'] = 0

# replacing values based on calculation
for index, col in chef_n.iterrows():
    revenue      = chef_n.loc[index, 'REVENUE']
    total_orders = chef_n.loc[index, 'TOTAL_MEALS_ORDERED']
    chef_n.loc[index, 'rev_per_meal'] = (revenue / total_orders).round(2)
        
# checking results
chef_n.loc[0:10,['rev_per_meal', 'REVENUE', 'TOTAL_MEALS_ORDERED']]
```


```python
# Updating our variables list after new features (only run once!)
continuous.append('rev_per_meal')
```


```python
# Determining Outliers in new variable
distributions('rev_per_meal', chef_n)

# Establishing Outlier Flags
rev_per_meal_hi = 70
rev_per_meal_lo = 15
outlier_flag_hi('rev_per_meal', rev_per_meal_hi, chef_n)
outlier_flag_lo('rev_per_meal', rev_per_meal_lo, chef_n)
```
<br><br>
<strong> Feature: </strong> Revenue per logins <br> <br>
When launching a new product, an important question is what channels to market the product in. Therefore, computing the revenue per logins for mobile and pc logins could help us understand user's buying behavior and better tailor our marketing strategy.


```python
# creating a copy of dataframe for safety measures
chef_n = chef_n.copy()

# new column for 'rev_per_login' feature
chef_n['rev_per_pclogin']     = 0
chef_n['rev_per_mobilelogin'] = 0

# replacing values based on calculation
for index, col in chef_n.iterrows():
    revenue       = chef_n.loc[index, 'REVENUE']
    PC_LOGINS     = chef_n.loc[index, 'PC_LOGINS']
    if PC_LOGINS   == 0:
        chef_n.loc[index, 'rev_per_pclogin'] = 0
    elif PC_LOGINS >= 0:
        chef_n.loc[index, 'rev_per_pclogin'] = (revenue / PC_LOGINS).round(2)
    else:
        print('Something went wrong.')

for index, col in chef_n.iterrows():
    revenue       = chef_n.loc[index, 'REVENUE']
    MOBILE_LOGINS = chef_n.loc[index, 'MOBILE_LOGINS']    
    if MOBILE_LOGINS   == 0:
        chef_n.loc[index, 'rev_per_mobilelogin'] = 0
    elif MOBILE_LOGINS >= 0:
        chef_n.loc[index, 'rev_per_mobilelogin'] = (revenue / MOBILE_LOGINS).round(2)
    else:
        print('Something went wrong.')

# checking results
chef_n.loc[0:10,['rev_per_mobilelogin', 'REVENUE', 'rev_per_pclogin']]


```


```python
# Determining Outliers in new variable
#distributions('rev_per_pclogin', chef_n)

# flagging outliers
rev_per_pclogin_hi = 800
rev_per_pclogin_lo = 150
outlier_flag_hi('rev_per_pclogin', rev_per_pclogin_hi, chef_n)
outlier_flag_lo('rev_per_pclogin', rev_per_pclogin_lo, chef_n)

```


```python
# Determining Outliers in new variable
#distributions('rev_per_mobilelogin', chef_n)

# flagging outliers
rev_per_mobilelogin_hi = 2500
rev_per_mobilelogin_lo = 200
outlier_flag_hi('rev_per_mobilelogin', rev_per_mobilelogin_hi, chef_n)
outlier_flag_lo('rev_per_mobilelogin', rev_per_mobilelogin_lo, chef_n)

```

### E) Feature Engineering: Trend Based Features

<strong> Purpose: </strong> Identify points in the relationships between explanatory variables and response variable where there is a clear separation between a success case and failure case.


Changes in variables behaviors in relation to our target variable can provide powerful explanations in our model as to how our success in selling Halfway There might be affected.
<br> <br>
In the following code, we visualize each variable's relationship with cross sell success with an user-defined function. We then set thresholds which will determine which observations are going to be considered having a differing effect on our success in selling Halfway There. Finally, we create a new feature for each of the variables that contain this difference, where a 1 will be imputed for these observations. <br><br>


```python
# calling the function for each categorical variable
for var in continuous + counts:
    trend_boxplots(cont_var = var,
                   response = 'CROSS_SELL_SUCCESS',
                   data     = chef_n)
```

<strong> Observations </strong>
(clear separations between success and failure):
- Avg time per site visit: huge outlier. After removing it still no clear separation between success and failure.
- Followed Recommendation Pct: high separation - low quartile of 1 is higher quartile of 0 
- Cancellations before noon: high separation - median for 1 is high quartile for 0

<strong> Need further investigation: </strong>
1. cancellations_before_noon
2. followed recommendations percentage

<br>
Cancellations before Noon Analysis:
```python
# Cancellations Before Noon Analysis
# count of cancellations before noon that subscribe to new service
did = chef_n.loc[:,'CANCELLATIONS_BEFORE_NOON'][chef_n.loc[:,'CROSS_SELL_SUCCESS'] == 1]\
                                                     [chef_n.loc[:,'CANCELLATIONS_BEFORE_NOON'] > 0]

# count of cancellations before noon that did not subscribe to new service
did_not = chef_n.loc[:,'CANCELLATIONS_BEFORE_NOON'][chef_n.loc[:,'CROSS_SELL_SUCCESS'] == 0]\
                                                   [chef_n.loc[:,'CANCELLATIONS_BEFORE_NOON'] > 0]
print(len(did))
print(len(did_not))
```

```python
    928
    351
```

```python
((928/(920+351))*100)
```

```python
    73.01337529504328
```
<br>
<strong> INSIGHT: </strong> Of those that have cancelled at least once before noon, 73% have subscribed to Halfway There.

<br>
Followed Recommendation Percentage Analysis:

```python
# Followed Recommendation Percentage Analysis
# count of Followed Recommendation Percentage that subscribe to new service
did = chef_n.loc[:,'FOLLOWED_RECOMMENDATIONS_PCT'][chef_n.loc[:,'CROSS_SELL_SUCCESS'] == 1]\
                                                     [chef_n.loc[:,'FOLLOWED_RECOMMENDATIONS_PCT'] > 20]

# count of cancellations before noon that did not subscribe to new service
did_not = chef_n.loc[:,'FOLLOWED_RECOMMENDATIONS_PCT'][chef_n.loc[:,'CROSS_SELL_SUCCESS'] == 0]\
                                                   [chef_n.loc[:,'FOLLOWED_RECOMMENDATIONS_PCT'] > 20]
print(len(did))
print(len(did_not))
```

```python
    877
    149
```


```python
877/(877+149)
```

```python
    0.854775828460039
```
<br>

<strong> INSIGHT: </strong> Of those that have followed a recommendation more than 20%, 85% have subscribed to Halfway There.


***
<strong> Feature engineering: </strong> creating flags from trend-based analysis


```python
# Establishing trend thresholds for analysis
# above this threshold its a succes
followed_recommendations_pct_1 = 20 #(or 30 for certainty)
cancellations_before_noon_1    = 2 #(or 1 for mean)
median_ratings_1               = 3
median_ratings_2               = 2

# Creating Dictionary to link variables with outlier thresholds
success_trend = {
    'FOLLOWED_RECOMMENDATIONS_PCT' : followed_recommendations_pct_1,
    'CANCELLATIONS_BEFORE_NOON'    : cancellations_before_noon_1,
    'MEDIAN_MEAL_RATING'           : median_ratings_1,
    'MEDIAN_MEAL_RATING'           : median_ratings_2
     }
```


```python
# creating a copy of dataframe for safety measures
chef_t = chef_n.copy()

# Looping over variables to create trend flags:
for key in success_trend.keys():
    success_flag(key,success_trend[key],chef_t)
```

### F) Correlations


```python
df_corr = chef_t.corr().round(2)
df_corr['CROSS_SELL_SUCCESS'].sort_values(ascending = True)
```

<strong> Observations: </strong>
- Junk email is negatively correlated to cross sell success <strong>(-0.28)</strong> -> if communications of the promotion were by email, then this makes sense, since junk emails are people that have other emails as to not receive promotions. 
- Professional <strong>(+0.19)</strong> -> people with these emails are more likely to subscribe, if communications about the subscription are through email, these are the ones that are going to open and click on it
<br><br>
--> because email communication is optional (i.e. only happens if the customer set their preferred method as email and not mobile which is default), then this correlation does not provide significant insight. Customers may have used a junk email because they prefer to receive sms and are as responsive to that as they would be on a professional email. More information is needed for a complete analysis.
<br> <br>
- Followed recommendations percentage highly correlated to success <strong>(+ 0.46) </strong> -> people that follow a lot of recommendations on the meal suggestions will most likely subscribe to the wine service
- Cancellations before noon <strong> (+0.16) </strong> -> not a high correlation but interesting. Hypothesis: 
    - Customers that cancel before noon might have a busier than usual schedule so committing to a meal delivery is harder than committing to a just half a bottle of wine (does not need to be drank with the meal)
<br>
<br>

## Part 2: Modeling

As seen previously, in classification models we need to ensure our target variable is balanced in terms of success and failure cases. If not, it could affect our model predictions. <br>

When splitting the data between training and testing sets, we need to ensure both cases are represented. We will do so through stratification.

### Preparation: Data Set Up


```python
# creating a copy for safety measures
chef = chef_t.copy()

# dropping discrete variables (only run once!)
chef = chef.drop(['NAME', 'FIRST_NAME', 'FAMILY_NAME'], axis = 1)

# checking the results
chef.columns
```
The following dictionary format allows us to easily test different variable combinations. These are the the variables tested for each instance.

```python
# Defining a dictionary with explanatory variables names 
variables_dict = {
    "target"     : [    # target variable

### A) Logistic Regression

We'll start with a logistic regression model. We'll be using statsmodel package to print out comprehensive summary to better understand our features and how they relate to cross sell success.

<strong> Step 1: </strong> Base Model (original variables) <br>
<strong> Step 2: </strong> Full Model (full logical features) <br>
<strong> Step 3: </strong> Fitted Model (significant features) <br>


### Step 1: Base Model
Preparation:


```python
###### Non Standardized Preparation 
# Defining explanatory variables (add according to new feature selections)
chef_base = chef.loc[: , variables_dict['Base']]

# train-test split with stratification
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
            chef_base,  # change
            chef_target,
            test_size = 0.25,
            random_state = seed,
            stratify = chef_target) # stratifying target variable to ensure balance

# merging training data for statsmodels
chef_train = pd.concat([X_train, y_train], axis = 1) # contains target ariable!


###### Standardized Preparation 
# Standardizing our Data Set (only numeric variables) with user-defined unction
chef_stand = standard(chef)

# Defining explanatory variables (add according to new feature selections)
chef_base_stand     = chef_stand.loc[: , variables_dict['Base']]

# train-test split with stratification
X_train_stand, X_test_stand, y_train_stand, y_test_stand = train_test_split(
            chef_base_stand,   # change
            chef_target,
            test_size = 0.25,
            random_state = seed,
            stratify = chef_target) 

# merging training data for statsmodels
chef_train_stand = pd.concat([X_train_stand, y_train_stand], axis = 1)
```

```python

                           data = chef_train)


# FITTING the model object
results_logistic = logistic_base.fit()

# checking the results SUMMARY
results_logistic.summary2()
```

<strong> Observations: </strong>
- LLR p-value: corresponds to the test statiscs for the model. The low p-value indicates that this model is explaining to a certain degree the cross sell success
- a lot of statistically insignificant variables are adding noise to our model
- significant variables: mobile_number (+0.7131), cancellations before noon (+0.2444), followed recommendations percentage (+0.0572)

### Step 2: Full Model
Logistic regression using variables created during exploratory data analysis.


```python
###### Non Standardized Preparation 
# Defining explanatory variables (add according to new feature selections)
chef_full = chef.loc[: , variables_dict['Full Model']]

# train-test split with stratification
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(

            random_state = seed,
            stratify = chef_target) # stratifying target variable to ensure balance

# merging training data for statsmodels
chef_train = pd.concat([X_train, y_train], axis = 1) # contains target variable!

# FITTING the model object

```

<strong> Observations: </strong>
- Significant Variables:
    - mobile number
    - cancellations before nooon
    - followed recommendations percentage
    - outliers in followed recommendations percentage lo
    - outlier in rev per meal lo
    - personal and professional emails (opposed to junk)
    - success in followed recommendations percentage


### Step 3: Fitted model


```python
# instantiating a logistic regression model object
# removed 'junk' as a base category for emails
logistic_fit = smf.logit(formula   = """ CROSS_SELL_SUCCESS ~ 
                                          MOBILE_NUMBER + 
                                          MOBILE_LOGINS +
                                          FOLLOWED_RECOMMENDATIONS_PCT +
                                          CANCELLATIONS_BEFORE_NOON + 
                                          TASTES_AND_PREFERENCES +
                                          AVG_PREP_VID_TIME +
                                          out_FOLLOWED_RECOMMENDATIONS_PCT_lo +

                                          success_FOLLOWED_RECOMMENDATIONS_PCT """,
                           data = chef_train)


# FITTING the model object
results_logistic = logistic_fit.fit()
results_logistic.summary()
```

<strong> Observations: </strong>
- tastes and preferences seem to not be as significant but since it is an actionable variable, we'll keep it in the model for further analysis
    - tastes and preference is at the moment an optional step for customers in the registration process
    - it might be that customers that fill out the tastes and preferences are more likely to be engaged with the service and more likely to encounter the promotion, or more likely to be interested in improving their experience
    - tastes and preferences could include a section on types of wine the customer enjoys
    
- since mobile number is significant, added mobile logins to understand customer purchase behavior
- average prep video time: somewhat significant, increases significance when we include other variables related to time on platform (avg clicks per visit, total photos viewed)
    - might indicate that perhaps customers enjoy having a glass of wine while preparing their food
    - marketing opportunity: add promotion on these videos (in house campaign has benefits)

<br>
<br>

### Step 4: Important Model Scores (sklearn)
Logistic regression using sklearn to find more details on the scoring. Still using the variables that showed important through exploratory data analysis:
- Mobile Number
- Mobile Logins
- AVG prep video time
- Cancellations Before Noon
- Tastes and Preferences
- Followed Recommendation Percentages (+ outlier and success flag)
- email categories: junk ,professional, personal


```python
###### Non Standardized Preparation 
# Defining explanatory variables (add according to new feature selections)
chef_imp = chef.loc[: , variables_dict['Best Model']]

# train-test split with stratification
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
            chef_imp,  # change
            chef_target,
            test_size = 0.25,
            random_state = seed,
            stratify = chef_target) # stratifying target variable to ensure balance

# merging training data for statsmodels
chef_train = pd.concat([X_train, y_train], axis = 1) # contains target variable!


# INSTANTIATING a logistic regression model
logreg = LogisticRegression(random_state = seed)

# FITTING the training data
logreg_fit = logreg.fit(X_train, y_train.values.reshape(-1,))


# PREDICTING based on the testing set
logreg_pred = logreg_fit.predict(X_test)

# train accuracy
logreg_train_acc  = logreg_fit.score(X_train, y_train).round(4)

# test accuracy
logreg_test_acc   = logreg_fit.score(X_test, y_test).round(4)

# auc value
logreg_auc = roc_auc_score(y_true  = y_test,
                           y_score = logreg_pred).round(4)

print('Training ACCURACY:', logreg_train_acc)
print('Testing  ACCURACY:', logreg_test_acc)
print('AUC Score        :', logreg_auc)
```
```python
    Training ACCURACY: 0.7629
    Testing  ACCURACY: 0.7392
    AUC Score        : 0.6997
```


<strong> Observations: </strong>
- model is well fitted based on training and testing score
- Convergence warning: need to increase number of iterations or run on scaled data

<br>
<br>
### Step 5: Logistic on Scaled Data


```python
###### Standardized Preparation 
# Standardizing our Data Set (only numeric variables) with user-defined function
chef_stand = standard(chef)

# Defining explanatory variables (add according to new feature selections)
chef_imp_stand     = chef_stand.loc[: , variables_dict['Best Model']]

# train-test split with stratification
X_train_stand, X_test_stand, y_train_stand, y_test_stand = train_test_split(
            chef_imp_stand,   # change
            chef_target,
            test_size = 0.25,
            random_state = seed,
            stratify = chef_target) 

# merging training data for statsmodels
chef_train_stand = pd.concat([X_train_stand, y_train_stand], axis = 1)

# Important model on Standardized data
# INSTANTIATING a logistic regression model
logreg_stand = LogisticRegression(random_state = seed) 

# FITTING the training data
logreg_fit_stand = logreg_stand.fit(X_train_stand, y_train.values.reshape(-1,)) # removes warning on column shape

# PREDICTING based on the testing set
logreg_pred_stand = logreg_fit_stand.predict(X_test_stand)

# train accuracy
logreg_train_acc_stand  = logreg_fit_stand.score(X_train_stand, y_train_stand).round(4)

# test accuracy
logreg_test_acc_stand   = logreg_fit_stand.score(X_test_stand, y_test_stand).round(4)

# auc value
logreg_auc_stand = roc_auc_score(y_true  = y_test_stand,
                           y_score = logreg_pred_stand).round(4)

print('Training ACCURACY:', logreg_train_acc_stand)
print('Testing  ACCURACY:', logreg_test_acc_stand)
print('AUC Score        :', logreg_auc_stand)
```

```python
    Training ACCURACY: 0.782
    Testing  ACCURACY: 0.7988
    AUC Score        : 0.7655
```


<strong> Observations: </strong>
- model on standardized data slightly improved in scores
- run hyperparameter tuning to increase score

<br>
<br>

### Step 6: Hyperparameter Tuning


```python
### GridSearchCV
# declaring a hyperparameter space
solver_space     = ['newton-cg', 'lbfgs', 'liblinear', 'sag', 'saga'] # use L2 penalty
C_space          = pd.np.arange(0.1, 3.0, 0.1)
warm_start_space = [True, False]


# creating a hyperparameter grid
param_grid = {'C'            : C_space,          
              'warm_start'   : warm_start_space,
              'solver'       : solver_space
             } 


# INSTANTIATING the model object without hyperparameters
lr_tuned = LogisticRegression(max_iter = 1000,
                              random_state = seed)


# GridSearchCV object
lr_tuned_cv = GridSearchCV(estimator  = lr_tuned, 
                           param_grid = param_grid, 
                           cv         = 3, 
                           scoring    = make_scorer(roc_auc_score,
                                                    needs_threshold = False))


# FITTING to the FULL DATASET (due to cross-validation)
lr_tuned_cv.fit(chef_imp_stand, chef_target.values.reshape(-1,))

### E) Gradient Boosting

### Step 1: Default Model with all Features


```python
###### Standardized Preparation 
# Standardizing our Data Set (only numeric variables) with user-defined function
chef_stand = standard(chef)

# Defining explanatory variables (add according to new feature selections)
chef_full_stand   = chef_stand.loc[: , variables_dict['Full Model']]

# train-test split with stratification
X_train_stand, X_test_stand, y_train_stand, y_test_stand = train_test_split(
            chef_full_stand,   # change
            chef_target,
            test_size = 0.25,
            random_state = seed,
            stratify = chef_target) 

# merging training data for statsmodels
chef_train_stand = pd.concat([X_train_stand, y_train_stand], axis = 1)


# INSTANTIATING the model object without hyperparameters
full_gbm_default = GradientBoostingClassifier()


# FIT step is needed as we are not using .best_estimator
full_gbm_default_fit = full_gbm_default.fit(X_train_stand, y_train_stand.values.reshape(-1,))


# PREDICTING based on the testing set
full_gbm_default_pred = full_gbm_default_fit.predict(X_test_stand)

gbm_train_score = full_gbm_default_fit.score(X_train_stand, y_train_stand).round(4)
gbm_test_score  = full_gbm_default_fit.score(X_test_stand, y_test_stand).round(4)
gbm_auc_score   = roc_auc_score(y_true  = y_test_stand,
                                y_score = full_gbm_default_pred).round(4)

# SCORING the results
print('Training ACCURACY:', gbm_train_score)
print('Testing ACCURACY :', gbm_test_score)
print('AUC Score        :', gbm_auc_score)
```
```python
    Training ACCURACY: 0.9034
    Testing ACCURACY : 0.7659
    AUC Score        : 0.7431
```


<strong> Observations: </strong>
- improved model performance
- run hyperparameter tuning

### Step 2: Hyperparameter Tuning


```python
## GridSearchCV
# declaring a hyperparameter space
learning_rate_space     = pd.np.arange(0.05,0.5,0.05)
n_estimators_space      = pd.np.arange(100,500,50)
min_samples_split_space = pd.np.arange(0.1,1,0.1)
min_samples_leaf_space  = pd.np.arange(1,5,1)
max_depth_space         = pd.np.arange(1,10,1)
warm_start_space              = [True, False]

# creating a hyperparameter grid
param_grid = {'learning_rate'     : learning_rate_space,          
              'n_estimators'      : n_estimators_space,
              'min_samples_split' : min_samples_split_space,
              'min_samples_leaf'  : min_samples_leaf_space,
              'max_depth'         : max_depth_space,
              'warm_start'        : warm_start_space
             } 


# INSTANTIATING the model object without hyperparameters
GB_tuned = GradientBoostingClassifier(random_state = seed)

# GridSearchCV object
knn_tuned_cv = GridSearchCV(estimator  = GB_tuned, 
                            param_grid = param_grid, 
                            cv         = 3, 
                            scoring    = make_scorer(roc_auc_score,
                                                    needs_threshold = False))


# FITTING to the FULL DATASET (due to cross-validation)
knn_tuned_cv.fit(chef_imp_stand, chef_target.values.reshape(-1,))

# printing the optimal parameters and best score
print("Tuned Parameters  :", knn_tuned_cv.best_params_)
print("Tuned CV AUC      :", knn_tuned_cv.best_score_.round(4))
```

```python
Tuned parameters: {'learning_rate': 0.01, 'max_depth': 9, 'min_samples_leaf': 1, 'min_samples_split': 0.6, 'n_estimators': 900}
Tuned CV AUC      : 0.6406
```

### Step 3: Feature Selection

Gradient boosting selects the best features that can explain our model. Here, we will use the cut-off at 0.01 to determine these features based on the box plots analysis we did earlier. Variable before this value did not show a significant separation between failure and success.


```python
# storing important features from gradient boosting as df 
gb_features = pd.DataFrame(full_gbm_default_fit.feature_importances_)
gb_features['Variable Names'] = chef_full_stand.columns

# Looking at insignificant coefficients
gb_features = gb_features.iloc[:,:][gb_features[0] >= 0.01].sort_values(by = 0) # cut-off based on boxplots analysis
gb_features

```


```python
###### Standardized Preparation 
# Standardizing our Data Set (only numeric variables) with user-defined function
chef_stand = standard(chef)

# Defining explanatory variables (add according to new feature selections)
chef_gb_stand   = chef_stand.loc[: , variables_dict['Best Model']]

# train-test split with stratification
X_train_stand, X_test_stand, y_train_stand, y_test_stand = train_test_split(
            chef_gb_stand,   # change
            chef_target,
            test_size = 0.25,
            random_state = seed,
            stratify = chef_target) 

# merging training data for statsmodels
chef_train_stand = pd.concat([X_train_stand, y_train_stand], axis = 1)


# INSTANTIATING the model object with hyperparameters
fit_gbm_tuned = GradientBoostingClassifier(learning_rate = 0.01,
                                           n_estimators = 900,
                                           min_samples_split = 0.6,
                                           min_samples_leaf = 1,
                                           max_depth = 9,
                                           warm_start = False,
                                           random_state = seed)

# FIT step is needed as we are not using .best_estimator
fit_gbm_tuned_fit = fit_gbm_tuned.fit(X_train_stand, y_train_stand.values.reshape(-1,))


# PREDICTING based on the testing set
fit_gbm_tuned_pred = fit_gbm_tuned_fit.predict(X_test_stand)

fit_gbm_train_score = fit_gbm_tuned_fit.score(X_train_stand, y_train_stand).round(4)
fit_gbm_test_score  = fit_gbm_tuned_fit.score(X_test_stand, y_test_stand).round(4)
fit_gbm_auc_score   = roc_auc_score(y_true  = y_test_stand,
                                   y_score = fit_gbm_tuned_pred).round(4)

# SCORING the results
print('Training ACCURACY:', fit_gbm_train_score)
print('Testing ACCURACY :', fit_gbm_test_score)
print('AUC Score        :', fit_gbm_auc_score)
```

```python
    Training ACCURACY: 0.8307
    Testing ACCURACY : 0.7864
    AUC Score        : 0.7666
```




## Part 3: Evaluating the model



![Model-Performance](/images/model-performance-classification.png)

According to the table above, the best model to predict if a customer will or not subscribe to Halfway There is the decision tree. In the following steps, we will interpret the results of the model and evaluate is applicability to the business case.


```python
# calling the visual_cm function
visual_cm(true_y = y_test,
          pred_y = tree_tuned_pred,
          labels = ['Did Not Buy Subscription', 'Bought Subscription'],
          title  = 'Confusion Matrix of Decision Tree Classifier')
```


![Confusion-Matrix-Decision-Tree-Classifier](/images/Confusion-Matrix-Decision-Tree-Classifier.png)


<strong> Observations: </strong><br>
Our model's errors (predicted that the customer was going to buy the subscription but did not, and predicted the customer was not going to buy the subscription and did) are well balanced based on our business case. <br>
<br>
In other words, our marketing expenditure for <i> Halfway There </i> is being well utilized, since our precision in which customers will subscribe is 96%.
<br> <br>
However, our marketing expenditures could be optimized since we can see 39 out of 331 customers were not predicted to buy the subscription and still bought it. If we were to better understand these customers, we could increase the total number of customer subscriptions.


***
## Conclusion

- Our best performing model was a Decision Tree with 21 features with a test score of 0.9058
- Optimal features were found using exploratory data analysis, domain knowledge and tree classifiers
- It is predicting whether or not a customer will subscribe to the new service Halfway There.
- Its precision in correctly predicting a new customer is 96%

## Business Insights

1. Customer Loyalty
<br>
We provide full refunds for customers that cancel before noon. This policy is contributing to increase our customer satisfaction and loyalty. Indeed, <strong> of those that have cancelled at least once before noon, 73% have subscribed to Halfway There. </strong>
<br>
Thus, allowing for full refunds in cancellations increases customer satisfaction and loyalty. Assuming the bottle delivery is independent from the meal delivery, our customer’s may have an easier time committing to a half-bottle wine delivery then a fresh full meal, increasing their loyalty to the brand. Once loyal, customers are more likely to subscribe to new services.

2. Recommendation System
<br>
Our recommendation system adapts to our customer’s previous purchases, lookalike scores and trending products. In the context of our new product, of customers that have previously followed our recommendations 20% of the time, 85% are subscribed to Halfway There. Additionally, customers that usually follow our recommendations are almost twice as likely to subscribe for this new service.
<br>
This group of customers is pickier with their meal options. Due to their busy schedules, they enjoy new offerings from recommendations, and take this opportunity to explore new tastes without the effort of research and appreciate the uniqueness of the local selection.

## Recommendations and Business Implementation

The number of customers that follow recommendations and the influence of communication channels are predictors of success in selling Halfway There. It indicates that a two-fold marketing strategy should be implemented when promoting the new service to a wider audience.
<br>

1) <strong> In-house: </strong> Customers that followed recommendations and that have watched preparation videos have proved to positively impact the success in selling Halfway There. Thus, implementing promotional videos inside our mobile and web platform would reduce marketing costs related to external parties and still be effective in reaching the desired customer (ex: advertisement videos before food prep videos promoting the wine as a drink while preparing the food).
<br>

2) <strong> Email Marketing: </strong> email campaigns are a cheap way to reach a great number of customers. Professional emails are positively correlated with successfully selling Halfway There, since customers access these inboxes multiple times a day. Therefore, we should consider an email campaign of the new service, in addition to make an email and email confirmation, required fields upon new customer registration.
